# DriverPass Project Reflection

## Brief Summary
The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The system needed to let users sign up, pay for lessons, take practice tests online, and schedule time with instructors. My job was to gather the requirements and design how the system would work through UML diagrams and written documentation.

## What I Did Well
I think I did a good job breaking down the user needs into clear steps. My diagrams, especially the activity diagram, showed the flow of actions in a way that’s easy to understand. I also made sure to keep the explanations simple so that a non-technical client could follow along.

## What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I’d spend more time improving the class diagram. I feel like I could have added more detail to the relationships between classes and maybe included some methods to make the design more complete.

## Interpreting User Needs
I looked at the requirements the client gave and thought about how a regular student would use the system. For example, they need to log in, pay, and choose lessons easily. I built those actions into the diagrams and descriptions. Considering the user’s needs is important because if the system doesn’t make sense to them, they won’t want to use it.

## My Approach to Design
When I design software, I try to start simple and then add detail as I go. I like to use diagrams to visualize the system because it makes it easier to see if something is missing. In the future, I’d also use more feedback from potential users and teammates to catch problems earlier.
